Assignment-1
============

This first assignment covers Cucumber Features for my final Project.

Project title: Theories into (real) practices

I want to build a web application which matches MOOC students with social organization or headhunters. 
The aim is to meet interests of all parts and unite knowledge and labour in one place. 
As Manuel Castells addresses: "Knowledge has always been important in organizing and fostering economic growth. 
But the greater the complexity and productivity of an economy, the greater the role played by new knowledge and 
new applications of knowledge (as compared with the mere addition of such production factors as capital or labour) 
in the growth of productiviy". (The Informational Economy)


Students may have the chance to choose between four options while enrolled in a Massive Open Online Course:
1- Only study
2- Study and find a volunteer experience (only available for students who complete a MOOC successfully)
3- Study and look for a job (only available for students who complete a MOOC successfully)
4 - Study, find a volunteer experience and look for a job (only available for students who complete a MOOC successfully)

At the same time, social organizations and headhunters may select students in the data base by looking at their profiles, see best
ones ranked, see most active ones and also their availability.
